# Algodoo Scene Thumbnail Editor
This program takes a scene package file from the 2D physics simulator [Algodoo](http://www.algodoo.com/) and replaces the thumbnail with a given image.

This is a WinForms app running on .NET Framework 4.8. I might port it to .NET Core once the .NET Core Windows Forms Designer for Visual Studio is officially released.
